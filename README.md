# Medicinal Plant Detection (ML Project)

Built a machine learning model to identify medicinal plants from images using Python in Google Colab.

## Overview
This project explores how machine learning can be applied to plant identification for healthcare and educational use cases. The notebook includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and sample predictions.

## Features
- Image-based plant classification  
- Data preprocessing and model training  
- Performance evaluation and prediction analysis  

## Tech Stack
- Python  
- Machine Learning (CNN-based approach)  
- Google Colab  
- NumPy, Pandas, image processing libraries  

## How to Run
1. Download the notebook  
2. Open in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook  
3. Run cells step by step
